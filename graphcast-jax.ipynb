    "# GraphCast\n",

    "## 1. 模型简介\n",
    "Graphcast是谷歌Deepmind提出的一种用于全球中期天气预报的的方法。并支持包括预测热带气旋路径、大气河流和极端气温在内的应用。\n",
    "该模型将地球天气的两个最新状态(当前时间和六个小时前)作为输入，并预测六小时后的天气状态。一个单独的天气状态由一个0.25维度/经度网格(721x1440)表示，这相当于赤道上大约28x28公里的分辨率，其中每个网格点代表一组地面和大气变量。Graphcast采用自回归的方式预测，可以通过反馈自己的预测结果作为输入来推理，从而生成任意长的天气状态轨迹。\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**模型结构**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphcast是一种基于机器学习的天气预报大模型，性能优于世界上最准确的机器学习天气预报系统。Deepmind以编码-处理-解码的方式使用图神经网络(Graph Neural Network，GNN)来创建一个自回归模型，共有3760万个参数。\n",
    "Graphcast三阶段模拟过程如下：\n",
    "\n",
    "1）第一阶段：编码阶段基于单个GNN将输入网格上表示为节点属性的变量映射到多网格图表示上的学习节点。\n",
    "\n",
    "2）第二阶段：处理器阶段使用16个非共享GNN层来在多网格上执行学习信息传递，使得能够以很少的消息传递步骤进行有效的本地和远程信息传递。\n",
    "\n",
    "3）第三阶段：解码器将来自多网格表示的第二阶段最终学习到的特征映射回纬度-经度网格，与第一阶段类似使用单个GNN层，并将输出预测作为残差更新最新的输入状态。\n",
